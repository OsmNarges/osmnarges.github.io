This work is the thesis project of my M.Sc. Degree in Computer Science at the School of Engineering, McMaster University. In this research project, we are designing a projectional editor for elm language called ElmSr that is suitable for teaching programming to kids and novice programmers. Our aim is to build a high-performant editor that helps kids learn computational thinking in the first place, without struggling too much with syntax in programming. A projectional editor does not allow for errors and maintains the code in an always-correct state.
