Students either fail to comprehend a range of fundamental programming concepts or carry misunderstandings and misconceptions about programming well into the semester, leading to summative assessment failures. Multiple choice questions in summative assessments are a popular choice of instrument to test novice learners of programming, yet during their formative stages such questions are typically used in the traditional \u0026#34;practice\u0026#34; or \u0026#34;rote learning\u0026#34; contexts, leaving gaps in understanding of programming concepts. In this paper we report the use of multiple choice exercises in a guided learning approach, within the learning context of novice programmers who are typically first-time university students of a Computer Science program. In addition to the use of multiple choice questions for practice, we propose a guided learning tool to identify cognitive lapses in learning programming. We report results of a pilot study that uses a partially-completed guided learning tool, to prevent students at the outset from falling into the cognitive traps that often ensnare the novice programmer.\u0026#34;","title":"Understanding novice programmer difficulties via guided learning","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1999747.1999808","citation_key":"Shuhidan2011Understanding"},"color":"rgb(192,192,192)","size":10.0},{"label":"Rodger (2014)","x":-1011.8589477539062,"y":-651.5661010742188,"id":"75","attributes":{"venue":"ITiCSE","comm":"0","keywords":"k-12 education, computer and information science education, introductory computer science, alice, virtual worlds, middle school","year":"2014","author":"Susan H.

In the context of novel digital technologies, where the \u0027novelty\u0027 factor is inherent in interaction with emergent technologies, the concept of engagement is often reported at a general level of description of fun and enjoyment. Although this importantly indicates positive appraisal of the environment it does not provide any detail about how the participants are \u0027engaged\u0027. For example, what are they doing and thinking about, where is their attention focused - is it on a learning task, a tangential entertaining activity or even the technology itself? This paper offers a more detailed analysis of students\u0027 foci of interaction, to provide insight into the different ways that children are both cognitively and physically engaged during a discovery-based learning experience. Three key foci of interaction within the learning space (learning concept, tangential activity, technology) were derived from video data analysis. A coding scheme for identifying these interaction foci was developed and applied to empirical data with a tangible learning environment. In depth analysis showed close relationships between the different foci of interaction and the learning process: engaging with a tangential activity in a exploratory interaction engendered cognitive engagement with domain related concepts; while engaging with technology to understand the basics of the system\u0027s functioning could facilitate higher levels of conceptual abstraction. This article highlights the different interaction foci that students take in innovative, technology-enhanced learning environments, and provides an analytical approach, which informs and extends current evaluation approaches towards student engagement in novel digital environments.\u0026#34;","title":"Where the attention is: Discovery learning in novel tangible environments","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.intcom.2011.06.003","citation_key":"Price2011Where"},"color":"rgb(192,192,192)","size":10.0},{"label":"Lund (2009)","x":-2735.405517578125,"y":2773.17333984375,"id":"112","attributes":{"venue":"Toyama","comm":"17","keywords":"control engineering computing, human-robot interaction, robot programming, cognitive abilities, disabled children, games creation, modular robotic playware, modular robotic tiles","year":"2009","author":"Henrik Hautop Lund, Patrizia Marti","dblp_id":"558b5e2784ae84d265c2fbb5","description":"\u003ctable\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eAuthor:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eHenrik Hautop Lund\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eTitle:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eDesigning modular robotic playware\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSource:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eToyama\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eYear:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e2009\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/table\u003e","Cluster":"20","main":"1","abstract":"\u0026#34;In this paper, we explore the design of modular robotic objects that may enhance playful experiences.

Digital games are often used in educational contexts to attract and retain students.

The programming difficulties involved in that process tend to distract attention away from the collaborative storytelling activity itself. This study therefore proposes an interaction model featuring tangible story avatars (TSAs) that can serve as a platform to scaffold collaborative story creation, revision and narrative. A 9-week study with 16 children aged 8 years was conducted to evaluate the interaction model with the TSAs. The results suggest that the TSAs may play three primary roles in facilitating collaborative storytelling: as a tool for developing confidence, as a tool for reflective story development and as a group artefact.

This paper presents ROSY, a novel language for teaching novice programmers through robotics. Its functional style is both familiar with a high-school algebra background and a materialization of the inherent reactive nature of robotic programming. Working at a higher-level of abstraction also teaches valuable design principles of decomposition of robotics software into collections of interacting controllers. Despite its simplicity, ROSY is completely valid Haskell code compatible with the ROS ecosystem. We make a convincing case for our language by demonstrating how non-trivial applications can be expressed with ease and clarity, exposing its sound functional programming foundations, and developing a web-enabled robot programming environment. \u0026#34;","title":"ROSY: An elegant language to teach the pure reactive nature of robot   programming","url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRC.2020.00045","citation_key":"Hugo2019ROSY"},"color":"rgb(192,192,192)","size":10.0},{"label":"Merino (2018)","x":2736.89306640625,"y":3048.052001953125,"id":"144","attributes":{"venue":"IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference","comm":"23","keywords":"education, programming, robotics, STEM","year":"2018","author":"Pedro Plaza Merino, Elio San Crist\u0026#243;bal, Germ\u0026#225;n Carro, Manuel Castro, Manuel Blazquez","dblp_id":"5b3d989917c44a510f7fe54e","description":"\u003ctable\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eAuthor:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003ePedro Plaza Merino\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eTitle:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eScratch day to introduce robotics.\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSource:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eIEEE Global Engineering Education Conference\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eYear:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e2018\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/table\u003e","Cluster":"26","main":"1","abstract":"\u0026#34;Scratch Day is made up of a global network of events.

Robotics and computational thinking are ideal tools for developing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy. Currently, innovation and motivation of students during the learning process are promoted by educational robotics tools. Robots are increasingly integrated into our society. To such an extent that robots arc becoming more and more common in our everyday environment. This paper presents a workshop which is focused on two main objectives. The first one is to celebrate Scratch Day promoting Scratch locally. On the other hand, this event is aimed to present a robotic educational tool for people as the first step to get into robotics world. This workshop is aimed on those adults who want to discover what possibilities Scratch brings in the introduction to robotics. Throughout this workshop an initiation to Scratch is developed in the context of educational robotics. As the most significant results throughout the workshop, it is clearly demonstrated that Scratch is an ideal tool for children and adults with no previous programming or robotic experience to begin learning both through hands-on experiences.

The approach is based on activity contextualization, environments for novices and a spiral learning approach. The experience was split into three contextualized blocks: Figures, Games and Images. In each block, concepts are (re)introduced and deepened in a spiral way. Lessons learned suggest that: context change impacts student motivation, the approach is partially adequate to the audience, the Scratch tool contributes to learning programming concepts, and appropriate tools help transitioning between block-based and text-based programming languages.\u0026#34;","title":"Contextualized Spiral Learning of Computer Programming in Brazilian Vocational Secondary Education","url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2018.8658456","citation_key":"Araujo2018Contextualized"},"color":"rgb(192,192,192)","size":10.0},{"label":"Fowler (2019)","x":53.637386322021484,"y":-1430.06298828125,"id":"149","attributes":{"venue":"Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games","comm":"0","keywords":"STEM,  children,  game design,  game development,  game jams,  programming","year":"2019","author":"Allan Fowler","dblp_id":"5d68f60ded7e9c7926560d9c","description":"\u003ctable\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eAuthor:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eAllan Fowler\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eTitle:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eJamming with children: an experience report\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSource:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eProceedings of the 14th International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eYear:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e2019\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/table\u003e","Cluster":"2","main":"1","abstract":"\u0026#34;Although there is an increase in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) career opportunities in most developed economies, the lack of qualified graduates to take these opportunities is a serious concern.

Twenty-five years after Logo\u0027s birth, there has been tremendous progress in programming language research and in computer-human interfaces. Programming languages exist now that are very expressive and mathematically very elegant and yet are difficult to learn and master. We believe the time is now ripe to attempt to repeat the success of the designers of Logo by child engineering one of these modern languages. When Logo was first built, a critical aspect was taking the computational constructs of the Lisp programming language and designing a child friendly syntax for them. Lisp\u0027s \u0027CAR\u0027 was replaced by \u0027FIRST\u0027, \u0027DEFUN\u0027 by \u0027TO\u0027, parentheses were eliminated, and so on. Today there are totally visual languages in which programs exist as pictures and not as text. We believe this is a step in the right direction, but even better than visual programs are animated programs Animation is much better suited for dealing with the dynamics of computer programs than static icons or diagrams. While there has been substantial progress in graphical user interfaces in the last twenty-five years, we chose to look not primarily at the desktop metaphor for ideas but instead at video games. Video games are typically more direct, more concrete, and easier to learn than other software. And more fun too. We have constructed a general-purpose concurrent programming system, ToonTalk, in which the source code is animated and the programming environment is a video game. Every abstract computational aspect is mapped into a concrete metaphor. For example, a computation is a city, an active object or agent is a house, birds carry messages between houses, a method or clause is a robot trained by the user and so on. The programmer controls a \u0027programmer persona\u0027 in this video world to construct, run, debug and modify programs. We believe that ToonTalk is especially well suited for giving children the opportunity to build real programs in a manner that is easy to learn and fun to do.

Over 400 articles were identified, and 68 articles met the inclusion criteria. A systematic analysis and synthesis across studies showed some evidence that computer game design and programming can lead to changes in programming knowledge, problem solving, and computer science attitudes and confidence. However, most of the evidence described engagement in computing-related practices and did not measure learning. The findings were mostly positive, although several studies noted more negative attitudes toward programming after making games. The results were similar across different pedagogical approaches, although social interaction may provide unique opportunities for computer science learning. The synthesis resulted in a list of design elements for studying computer game design and programming activities; these can be used to increase the availability of evidence about learning.

With over 4000 students in inner city, remote rural, and Native American communities Scalable Game Design has investigated the impact on students\u0027 interest level of pedagogical approaches employed by teachers such as mediation and scaffolding. Findings suggest strong gender effects based on classroom scaffolding approaches. For instance, girls are substantially less likely to be motivated through scaffolding based on direct instruction.

Declarative programming paradigms involving complex operational details, such as constraint solving and lazy evaluation, do not fit well to traditional debugging techniques relying on the inspection of low-level computation traces. As a solution to this problem, declarative diagnosis uses Computation Trees (shortly, CTs) in place of traces. CTs are built a posteriori to represent the structure of a computation whose top level outcome is regarded as an error symptom by the user. Each node in a CT represents the computation of some observable result, depending on the results of its children nodes. Declarative diagnosis explores a CT looking for a so-called buggy node which computes an incorrect result from children whose results are correct; such a node must point to an incorrect program fragment. The search for a buggy node can be implemented with the help of an external oracle (usually the user with some semiautomatic support) who has a reliable declarative knowledge of the expected program semantics, the so-called intended interpretation.\u0026#34;","title":"Declarative diagnosis of wrong answers in constraint functional-logic programming","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11799573_31","citation_key":"Caballero2006Declarative"},"color":"rgb(192,192,192)","size":11.666666984558105},{"label":"Hakulinen (2013)","x":-1092.758056640625,"y":-3784.56201171875,"id":"17","attributes":{"venue":"MindTrek08","comm":"3","keywords":"spatial control framework, complex parameter, new kind, individual light fixture, individual fixture, traditional lighting control, low level, multi-tiered software framework, new model, interactive lighting, spatial lighting service level, diverse set, interaction design, software architecture","year":"2013","author":"Jaakko Hakulinen, Markku Turunen, Tomi Heimonen","dblp_id":"53e9a19bb7602d9702a908ca","description":"\u003ctable\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eAuthor:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eJaakko Hakulinen\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eTitle:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSpatial Control Framework for Interactive Lighting\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSource:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eMindTrek08\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eYear:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e2013\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/table\u003e","Cluster":"8","main":"1","abstract":"\u0026#34;Lighting has become an integral element in interactive environments as a result of advances in LED and home automation technology.

To overcome this difficulty, we have to specify the right starting point of teaching basic object-oriented concepts and mark out the appropriate educational tools. In this paper, trying to answer the above questions, we present a research proposal on how fundamental object-oriented programming concepts could be introduced to children in early childhood education when physical science courses take place. The backbone of our research is the digital environment PhysGramming, through which children turn into creators, according to the theory of constructivism. The innovative aspect of PhysGramming is that children create their own games while studying physical science, in a way that provides familiarity with the basic principles of object-oriented programming and computational thinking, even though no specific reference is made to these principles.\u0026#34;","title":"Introducing fundamental object-oriented programming concepts in preschool education within the context of physical science courses.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-018-9736-0","citation_key":"Kanaki2018Introducing"},"color":"rgb(223,137,255)","size":10.0},{"label":"Allan Fowler (2012)","x":-125.9295425415039,"y":-1549.10107421875,"id":"93","attributes":{"venue":"The Computer Games Journal","comm":"0","keywords":"Kodu Game Lab, programming, computer games, children, 3D","year":"2012","author":"Allan\u0026#160;Fowler, Teale\u0026#160;Fristce, Matthew\u0026#160;MacLauren","dblp_id":"5c3b385fdf5b8c0b3c9e2cf8","description":"\u003ctable\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eAuthor:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eAllan\u0026#160;Fowler\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eTitle:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eKodu Game Lab: a programming environment\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSource:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eThe Computer Games Journal\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eYear:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e2012\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/table\u003e","Cluster":"2","main":"1","abstract":"\u0026#34;Kodu Game Lab is a tile-based visual programming tool that enables users to learn programming concepts through making and playing computer games.

While the learning goals were achieved to a high degree, the analysis of participants\u0027 interaction with the system reveals interesting phenomena about user preferences, such as the fact that during the given computational thinking tasks, the participants preferred the synchronous communication channel to other forms of commonly provided learning resources such as forums.\u0026#34;","title":"Analyzing the Learning Process in Online Educational Game Design: A Case Study","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ASWEC.2014.34","citation_key":"Ahmadi2014Analyzing"},"color":"rgb(255,136,5)","size":15.0},{"label":"Strawhacker (2015)","x":-160.5862274169922,"y":-1056.77978515625,"id":"90","attributes":{"venue":"Interaction Design and Children","comm":"0","keywords":"","year":"2015","author":"Amanda Strawhacker, Melissa Lee, Claire Caine, Marina Umaschi Bers","dblp_id":"573697616e3b12023e649ff5","description":"\u003ctable\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eAuthor:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eAmanda Strawhacker\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eTitle:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eScratchJr demo: a coding language for kindergarten\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSource:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eInteraction Design and Children\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eYear:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e2015\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/table\u003e","Cluster":"0","main":"1","abstract":"\u0026#34;This paper describes the ScratchJr research project, a collaboration between Tufts University\u0027s Developmental Technologies Research Group, MIT\u0027s Lifelong Kindergarten Group, and the Playful Invention Company.

To test this, we designed a game called Gidget, in which players help a robot find and fix defects in programs that follow a mastery learning paradigm. Across two studies, we manipulated the inclusion of multiple choice and self-explanation assessment levels in the game, measuring their impact on engagement and level completion speed. In our first study, we found that including assessments caused learners to voluntarily play longer and complete more levels, suggesting increased engagement; in our second study, we found that including assessments caused learners to complete levels faster, suggesting increased understanding.

Running parallel to this trend are advances in programming environments and teaching methods which aim to make computer science more accessible, and more motivating. In this paper, we describe the design and evaluation of Flip, a programming language that aims to help 11\u0026#8211;15 year olds develop computational skills through creating their own 3D role-playing games. Flip has two main components: 1) a visual language (based on an interlocking blocks design common to many current visual languages), and 2) a dynamically updating natural language version of the script under creation. This programming-language/natural-language pairing is a unique feature of Flip, designed to allow learners to draw upon their familiarity with natural language to \u0026#8220;decode the code\u0026#8221;. Flip aims to support young people in developing an understanding of computational concepts as well as the skills to use and communicate these concepts effectively. This paper investigates the extent to which Flip can be used by young people to create working scripts, and examines improvements in their expression of computational rules and concepts after using the tool. We provide an overview of the design and implementation of Flip before describing an evaluation study carried out with 12\u0026#8211;13 year olds in a naturalistic setting. Over the course of 8 weeks, the majority of students were able to use Flip to write small programs to bring about interactive behaviours in the games they created. Furthermore, there was a significant improvement in their computational communication after using Flip (as measured by a pre/post-test). An additional finding was that girls wrote more, and more complex, scripts than did boys, and there was a trend for girls to show greater learning gains relative to the boys.\u0026#34;","title":"Learning to communicate computationally with Flip: A bi-modal programming language for game creation.","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2014.08.014","citation_key":"Howland2015Learning"},"color":"rgb(223,137,255)","size":21.66666603088379},{"label":"Arawjo (2017)","x":-281.5890808105469,"y":1068.9439697265625,"id":"107","attributes":{"venue":"CHI","comm":"5","keywords":" ","year":"2017","author":"Ian Arawjo, Cheng-Yao Wang, Andrew C.

Specifically, where the goal is to help individuals develop their understanding of computation and/or use computation in real world settings, we question whether natural language might be a preferred notation to traditional programming languages, given its familiarity and ubiquity. We describe three empirical studies investigating the use of natural language for computation in which we found that although natural language provides support for understanding computational concepts, it introduces additional difficulties when used for coding. We distilled our findings into a set of design guidelines for novice programming environments which consider the ways in which different notations, including natural language, can best support the various activities that comprise programming. These guidelines were embodied in Flip, a bi-modal programming language used in conjunction with the Electron toolset, which allows young people to create their own commercial quality, narrative based role- playing games. Two empirical studies on the use of Flip in three different real world contexts considered the extent to which the design guidelines support ease of use and an understanding of computation. The guidelines have potential to be of use both in analysing the use of natural language in existing novice programming environments, and in the design of new ones. HighlightsNatural language presents problems when used for program generation.Natural language is beneficial when used for program comprehension and debugging.Novice programming environments should use multiple notations for support.\u0026#34;","title":"Programming language, natural language?

Additionally, with K-12 standardized testing moving online, students are being required to improve their computer skills, which, among other factors, has also motivated the discussion to add computer science to the core curriculum [6, 8, 35, 22]. Educational programming languages, such as Scratch [25] and Alice [11], have a set of features that foster their use with younger students [27] such as drag-and-drop, limited API, and visual output. Given that novices can be introduced to such educational languages with a basic understanding of computer science concepts, industry-standard programming languages like Java can now be introduced to younger students. This paper re-introduces CodeSpells [14, 13, 15], a 3D immersive video game that is unique in that it attempts to engage students in introductory computing concepts in similar ways to Scratch/Alice, but using Java, while providing them a metaphor of wizardry that attempts to mimic the culture of computer science. CodeSpells has been shown to engage students in confidently writing Java code, but it has yet been shown to result in students being able to write Java code, or begin to become computer scientists. In this paper, we show the results of an 8-week study conducted on 55 9-10 year old students across two different schools. Throughout the study, students not only played CodeSpells, but also used a guided workbook to explore Java code outside of the CodeSpells virtual environment.

Especially in educational settings, children are exposed to computational thinking by making games, building scientific simulations and creating stories. Early educational programming languages such as Logo have made programming substantially more accessible to end-users. More recent approaches include visual programming with a drag-and-drop style of programming that makes it nearly impossible to compose syntactically incorrect programs.

In this paper, we present a storytelling approach, which is based on the premise that story and narrative may emerge from characters\u0026#8217; interactions during the creation activity, but such characters may either act autonomously or be controlled by children. Since we position our research in an educational context, we argue that in such creation activities children\u0026#8217;s thoughts and needs must be respected and contribute directly to the achievement of the story. Therefore, children should be provided with some support and guidance directives to help them to better understand and reflect on the role-taking situations they experience during such activity. To prove the validity of our approach we developed a generic architecture\u0026#8212;Support And Guidance Architecture (SAGA). SAGA aims not only to provide support and guidance to children during the story telling activities, by combining the roles of a dynamic script writer and a drama manager, but also to provide such services to already existing story creation applications. To illustrate this, we have integrated SAGA with Teatrix, a collaborative virtual environment for story creation, and an evaluation study was conducted in order to find the impact of SAGA in children\u0026#8217;s storytelling activities.\u0026#34;","title":"Tell Me a Story","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10055-005-0002-6","citation_key":"machado2005Tell"},"color":"rgb(192,192,192)","size":10.0},{"label":"Dwarika (2015)","x":4218.64013671875,"y":-1170.833740234375,"id":"86","attributes":{"venue":"SAICSIT Conf.","comm":"15","keywords":"","year":"2015","author":"Jeraline Dwarika, Ruth de Villiers","dblp_id":"573696c66e3b12023e5c6d55","description":"\u003ctable\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eAuthor:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eJeraline Dwarika\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eTitle:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eUse of the Alice visual environment in teaching and learning object-oriented programming.\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSource:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSAICSIT Conf.\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eYear:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e2015\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/table\u003e","Cluster":"18","main":"1","abstract":"\u0026#34;Learners at tertiary institutions struggle with writing object-oriented programs in complex object-oriented programming (OOP) languages.

This allows children to focus on reassembly and direct observation of the resulting movement from simple changes made to a constructed structure. The gameplay of Kinematics is similar to classic construction games; by re-combining different elements, one can assemble increasingly complex structures. The shape-changing/rotating feature of the active blocks results in movement of the whole structure. The geometric shapes of these blocks are cubes, cuboids, cylinders, and triangular prisms. Plug-and-socket connectors (TRRS jacks) hold the blocks together and are the pivot points for rotating. They also provide data and power lines. Through simply rotating a single element, or putting it in a different position within the structure, the child can directly and intuitively manipulate the resulting movement.

Graphical rewrite rules have some similarities with comics strips, which also use picture sequences of graphical objects to describe dynamics in a static form. However, the visual language of comics is not used to its full potential in visual programming. We discuss how a semiotic analysis of comics can be used to address some of the limitations of graphical rewrite rules. We use a visual programming system we have designed to illustrate that comic strips can express more general computations and be more intuitive and flexible than traditional graphical rewrites.

It is possible, however, that attributing this failure to the computer, rather than the learner, may improve learners\u0027 motivation to program. To test this hypothesis, we present Gidget, a game where the eponymous robot protagonist is cast as a fallible character that blames itself for not being able to correctly write code to complete its missions. Players learn programming by working with Gidget to debug its problematic code. In a two-condition controlled experiment, we manipulated Gidget\u0027s level of personification in: communication style, sound effects, and image. We tested our game with 116 self-described novice programmers recruited on Amazon\u0027s Mechanical Turk and found that, when given the option to quit at any time, those in the experimental condition (with a personable Gidget) completed significantly more levels in a similar amount of time. Participants in the control and experimental groups played the game for an average time of 39.4 minutes (SD\u003d34.3) and 50.1 minutes (SD\u003d42.6) respectively.

After all, functional programming is a form of algebra and programming is a creative activity about problem solving. Introducing it into mathematics courses would make pre-algebra course come alive. If input and output were invisible, students could implement fun simulations, animations, and even interactive and distributed games all while using nothing more than plain mathematics. We have implemented this vision with a simple framework for purely functional I/O. Using this framework, students design, implement, and test plain mathematical functions over numbers, booleans, string, and images. Then the framework wires them up to devices and performs all the translation from external information to internal data (and vice versa)--just like every other operating system.

We present an iterative design process in which 65 children aged 512 participated in different iterations, concluding with the design of GameBaker. GameBaker is an application that allows children to modify game rules for Head Up Games, outdoor collocated games supported by interactive handheld devices. We show how children: understand how setting different game rules allows them to modify the game, are able to relate these to how the game is played, and enjoy doing so.

The pre- and post-test exams consisted of 24 multiple choice questions that were selected and validated based on data from 1,494 crowdsourced respondents. All 60 of our novices across the three conditions did poorly on the exams overall in both the pre-tests and post-tests (e.g., the best median post-test score was 50% correct). However, those completing the Codecademy course and those playing through the Gidget game showed over a 100% increase in correct answers when comparing their post-test exam scores to their pre-test exam scores. Those playing Gidget, however, achieved these same learning gains in half the time. This was in contrast to novices that used the puzzle designer, who did not show any measurable learning gains. All participants performed similarly within their own conditions, regardless of gender, age, or education.

Of the distinct techniques introduced in the literature to engage students, gamification, is likely the most widely explored and fruitful. Game elements that intrinsically motivate students, such as graphical feedback and game-thinking, reveal more reliable long-term positive effects, but those involve significant development effort. This paper proposes a game-based assessment environment for programming challenges, built on top of a specialized framework, in which students develop a program to control the player, henceforth called Software Agent (SA). During the coding phase, students can resort to the graphical feedback demonstrating how the game unfolds to improve their programs and complete the proposed tasks. This environment also promotes competition through competitive evaluation and tournaments among SAs, optionally organized at the end by the teacher.

One approach to provide these opportunities is to focus on social game play. Understanding game play is common across a range of media and ages. Children can begin by solving puzzles on paper, continue on game boards, and ultimately complete their solutions on computers. Through this process, learners can be guided through increasingly complex algorithmic thinking activities that are built from their tacit knowledge and excitement about game play. This paper describes our approach to teaching computational thinking skills without traditional programming\u0026#8212;but instead by building on children\u0026#8217;s existing game playing interest and skills. We built a system called CTArcade, with an initial game (Tic-Tac-Toe), which we evaluated with 18 children aged 10\u0026#8211;15.

Results show that the game was inclusive and collaborative, since all children contributed to the achievement of the final goal, regardless their cognitive ability. Interestingly, there were no remarkable differences in retention of the story. All children remembered most of the details of the story, even if the children with a mild cognitive disability summarized it in fewer sentences, whilst children with typical development showed richer narrative competencies.

Throughout this paper a modular and adaptive course is presented, the main objective of which is to make known simple and economic tools of educational robotics. This course is aimed at those who want to discover the possibilities of educational robotics in the context of the introduction to robotics. Today, robotics training tools are raised with the aim of promoting innovation and motivation of students during the learning process. Robots are becoming more and more common in our daily lives; therefore, it is important to integrate robots into all levels of our society. The course is designed to work with the Scratch, Crumble and Arduino tools as STEM enhancers. Using Scratch, interactive stories, games and animations can be programmed. Scratch helps young people to acquire and improve skills such as think creatively, think systematically, and work collaboratively. Scratch is a project of MIT Media Lab\u0027s Lifelong Kindergarten Group. It is offered free of charge. On the other hand, Crumble is an easy-to-use programmable controller. Its programming interface uses a block programming language based on Scratch that makes it easy for children from 10 years old to use it. In addition, the hardware elements associated with Crumble are very intuitive and easy to connect. Last, but not least, Arduino is an open source electronic platform based on hardware and software that is easy to use. It is a platform that incorporates a simple microcontroller and an interface development environment to create the applications to be downloaded on the board. The course offers a three-tiered journey through three levels with each of the three tools. It consists of a total of 9 modules. This course has a very practical approach. A project-based pedagogical methodology is used. Experiments are promoted, where trial and error are part of learning and self-discovery. The student learns to have more autonomy and responsibility. Knowledge is acquired in different disciplines. It develops: motor skills (scale mobility in the hands), group skills, allowing people to socialize, creative abilities, and learning in a fun way. The operational details, materials used and examples of activities for some modules are also presented with the expectation that all teachers will be able to adapt these activities in their class. In addition, results are included from several groups of students who have already completed some modules. Despite not having a large number of students, the experience provided results that may be useful for other teachers to promote a course with similar or equal content for more results. The results of this work show that it is important to combine theory and practice to include fun tasks intertwined with the challenges of applying theory to problem solving.\u0026#34;","title":"Multiplatform Educational Robotics Course to Introduce Children in Robotics","url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2018.8658513","citation_key":"Plaza2018Multiplatform"},"color":"rgb(192,192,192)","size":10.0},{"label":"Kindborg (2001)","x":4.483495235443115,"y":-3944.452392578125,"id":"57","attributes":{"venue":"HCC","comm":"10","keywords":"paper prototype, children understand, comic strip, concurrent comics, narrative interpretation, greater extent, hifi prototypes, computer prototype, plausible interpretation, old child, eleven year, low fidelity paper prototype, high fidelity computer prototype, computer science education, concurrent computing, prototypes, programming, computer science, arithmetic, animation, strips","year":"2001","author":"Mikael Kindborg","dblp_id":"53e9b9fab7602d97045f4b9a","description":"\u003ctable\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eAuthor:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eMikael Kindborg\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eTitle:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eHow Children Understand Concurrent Comics: Experiences from LOFI and HIFI Prototypes\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSource:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eHCC\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eYear:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e2001\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/table\u003e","Cluster":"14","main":"1","abstract":"\u0026#34;In a study of how ten to eleven year old children understandprogram representations based on comic strips,it turned out that narrative interpretations were morecommon when using a low fidelity paper prototype thanwhen using a high fidelity computer prototype.

Yet, little is known about the effects of these skills on children\u0027s cognitive development. In a cluster-randomized controlled trial, we examined how 1st-grade children\u0027s gains in coding skills that follow instructional intervention transfer to two important executive functions (EFs): planning and response inhibition. One-hundred seventy-nine (179) first graders from 5 schools and 10 class groups, with no prior experience of coding, were randomly assigned to an experimental (coding, 5 classes) or control (standard STEM, 5 classes) instructional condition. The experimental intervention involved 8\u0026#160;h of coding activities (two weekly lessons for 4 weeks), through the Code.org platform. Children in the control group were exposed to standard STEM instruction. Four coding tasks drawn from Code.org, two standardized planning tasks (Elithorn maze test and Tower of London, ToL, test) and two standardized response inhibition tasks (NEPSY-II inhibition subtest and numerical Stroop), were used to assess children\u0027s skills at the pretest and posttest (after the instructional intervention). To measure retention, the same skills were also assessed for 44 children from the experimental group 5 weeks from the posttest (follow up). The results show that practice with coding through Code.org not only improved measurably children\u0027s ability to solve coding problems, but also their EFs, increasing the time children spent planning, their ability to solve standardized planning tasks, and to inhibit prepotent responses. Such findings add to the still limited literature on the cognitive effects of coding, deepening our understanding of the positive implications of introducing Computational Thinking early in the school curriculum.\u0026#34;","title":"The effects of coding on children\u0027s planning and inhibition skills.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103807","citation_key":"Arf\u0026#233;2020The"},"color":"rgb(223,137,255)","size":10.0},{"label":"Finkelstein (2009)","x":89.9399185180664,"y":3098.267333984375,"id":"170","attributes":{"venue":"VR","comm":"28","keywords":"computer programming, virtual human, new game design, programming concept, computer programming concept, programming logic, virtual humans, emotion recognition, full game, new game, teach emotion recognition, interactive virtual character, visual drag-and-drop programming interface, interactive interface, programming, logic programming, teaching, logic design, social skill, face recognition, encoding, game design, pediatrics, games, autism, computer science education, facial expression, virtual reality","year":"2009","author":"Samantha L.

Unfortunately, learning how to program is tough and can be also frustrating for beginner students. In this work we introduce RoboTIC, a serious game based on gamification and Augmented Reality that facilitates the learning of programming to students in lower levels of the education system by using a novel set of visual metaphors derived from a notation of roads and traffic signs. The architecture that supports RoboTIC has been designed to allow the integration of multimedia components when new programming concepts and techniques must be addressed and to add game levels that enable students to learn incrementally. Experiments have been conducted in a youth center with children who do not have coding skills at all to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal.

To this end, we propose that a robotic learning companion could supplement children\u0027s early language education. The robot targets both the social nature of language learning and the adaptation necessary to help individual children. The robot is designed as a social character that interacts with children as a peer, not as a tutor or teacher. It will play a storytelling game, during which it will introduce new vocabulary words, and model good story narration skills, such as including a beginning, middle, and end; varying sentence structure; and keeping cohesion across the story. We will evaluate whether adapting the robot\u0027s level of language to the child\u0027s - so that, as children improve their storytelling skills, so does the robot - influences (i) whether children learn new words from the robot, (ii) the complexity and style of stories children tell, (iii) the similarity of children\u0027s stories to the robot\u0027s stories. We expect children will learn more from a robot that adapts to maintain an equal or greater ability than the children, and that they will copy its stories and narration style more than they would with a robot that does not adapt (a robot of lesser ability). However, we also expect that playing with a robot of lesser ability could prompt teaching or mentoring behavior from children, which could also be beneficial to language learning.\u0026#34;","title":"Storytelling with robots: Learning companions for preschool children\u0027s language development","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ROMAN.2014.6926325","citation_key":"Kory2014Storytelling"},"color":"rgb(192,192,192)","size":10.0},{"label":"Ahmadi (2012)","x":-2072.68408203125,"y":1183.677978515625,"id":"81","attributes":{"venue":"APSEC), 2012 19th Asia-Pacific","comm":"0","keywords":"Internet, computer aided instruction, computer games, computer science education, groupware, software engineering, HTML5, JavaScript, Web 2.0 technology, Web site, agent Web usability, collaborative platform, computer programming, desktop-based application, end-user game programming, game design activity, mobile device, open-Web educational game design, social learning, software engineering, teaching, Open Web, Web 2.0, end-user programming, game design environments, high-level languages, performance evaluation, usability testing","year":"2012","author":"Navid Ahmadi, Mehdi Jazayeri, Alexander Repenning","dblp_id":"558bb4a8e4b0cfb70a195d7b","description":"\u003ctable\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eAuthor:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eNavid Ahmadi\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eTitle:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eEngineering an Open-Web Educational Game Design Environment\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSource:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eAPSEC), 2012 19th Asia-Pacific\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eYear:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e2012\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/table\u003e","Cluster":"4","main":"1","abstract":"\u0026#34;Educational game design environments have long been employed as an engaging medium for teaching computer programming and software engineering concepts such as objects, agents, instances, behavior, and interaction.

In particular, we focus on investigating three specific aspects: (1) the potential of digital story composition conducted collaboratively or individually, (2) the children\u0027s perception on the use of digital storytelling for reflecting on conflicts that might arise in class and, (3) the teachers\u0027 experience of introducing a digital tool for collaborative storytelling and comics composition in an educational context. In this paper, we explored these aspects by developing a case study. A class of 12 children and 2 teachers explore the use of a digital tool, named Communics, aimed at creating digital narratives individually and collaboratively. The results show that digital narratives created from collaborative storytelling are longer, more structured, and richer with meaning compared to stories from individual work. Moreover, it emerged that children prefer to work collaboratively, even if it meant compromising, going slower and waiting for their turn. Finally, teachers appreciated the collaborative use of Communics, and in particular, the turn-based feature as children can practice the narrative re-elaboration with a peer while waiting for their turn.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#34;","title":"Collaborative comic-based digital storytelling with primary school children","url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3392063.3394433","citation_key":"Rutta2020Collaborative"},"color":"rgb(192,192,192)","size":10.0},{"label":"Wang (2011)","x":1314.2918701171875,"y":-379.2705993652344,"id":"16","attributes":{"venue":"IDC","comm":"0","keywords":"tangible programming block, programming sequence, user study, interesting programming approach, semantic correctness, wooden block, tangible programming tool, own maze map, programming language, sensors, programming languages, real time","year":"2011","author":"Danli Wang, Cheng Zhang, Hongan Wang","dblp_id":"53e9a1a1b7602d9702a967c5","description":"\u003ctable\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eAuthor:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eDanli Wang\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eTitle:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eT-Maze: a tangible programming tool for children\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSource:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eIDC\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eYear:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e2011\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/table\u003e","Cluster":"2","main":"1","abstract":"\u0026#34;This paper presents a tangible programming tool \u0027T-Maze\u0027 for children aged 5 to 9.

Research suggests many children, especially girls, want to create games based on dynamic relationships, social interactions, and storytelling. But game creation tools aimed at beginners offer no support for game mechanics that would enable such games.

The basic principle of constructivist education is that learning occurs when the learner is actively involved in a process of knowledge construction. In this study, storytelling was used as a paradigm of a constructive educational activity. An interactive robot served as a teacher assistant by telling prerecorded stories to small groups of children while incorporating song and motor activities in the process.

At the same time, the proliferation of Intelligent Environments has raised the need for configuring their behaviors to address their users\u0026#8217; needs. This configuration can take the form of programming, and coupled with advances in Augmented Reality and Conversational Agents, can enable users to take control of their intelligent surroundings in an efficient and natural manner. Focusing on children, who can greatly benefit by being immersed in programming from an early age, this paper presents an authoring framework in the form of an Augmented Reality serious game, named MagiPlay, allowing children to manipulate and program their Intelligent Environment. This is achieved through a handheld device, which children can use to capture smart objects via its camera and subsequently create rules dictating their behavior. An intuitive user interface permits players to combine LEGO-like 3D bricks as a part of the rule-based creation process, aiming to make the experience more natural. Additionally, children can communicate with the system via natural language through a Conversational Agent, in order to configure the rules by talking with a human-like agent, while the agent also serves as a guide/helper for the player, providing context-sensitive tips for every part of the rule creation process. Finally, MagiPlay enables networked collaboration, to allow parental and teacher guidance and support. The main objective of this research work is to provide young learners with a fun and engaging way to program their intelligent surroundings.

Ceptre can be viewed as an explication of a new methodology for understanding games based on linear logic, a formal logic concerned with resource usage. We present a correspondence between gameplay and proof search in linear logic, building on prior work on generating narratives. In Ceptre, we introduce the ability to add interactivity selectively into a generative model, enabling inspection of intermediate states for debugging and exploration as well as a means of play. We claim that this methodology can support game designers and researchers in designing, anaylzing, and debugging the core systems of their work in generative, multi-agent gameplay. To support this claim, we provide two case studies implemented in Ceptre, one from interactive narrative and one from a strategy-like domain. Introduction Today, game designers and developers have a wealth of tools available for creating executable prototypes. Freelyavailable engines such as Twine, Unity, PuzzleScript, and Inform 7 provide carefully-crafted interfaces to creating different subdomains of games. On the other hand, to invent interesting, novel mechanics in any of these tools typically requires the use of ill-specified, general purpose languages: in Twine, manipulating state requires dipping into JavaScript; in Unity, specifying any interactive behavior requires learning a language such as C# or JavaScript; Inform 7 contains its own general-purpose imperative, functional, and logic programming languages; and PuzzleScript simply prevents the author from going outside the well-specified 2D tile grid mechanisms. The concept of operational logics (Mateas and WardripFruin 2009), the underlying substrate of meaningful statechange operations atop which mechanics are built, was recently proposed as a missing but critical component of game design and analysis. In most prototyping tools, there is a Copyright c \u0026#169; 2015, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. fixed operational logic (e.g. tile grids and layers in PuzzleScript, or text command-based navigation of a space in Inform 7) atop which the designer may be inventive in terms of rules and appearance, but all rules must be formed out of entities that mean something in the given operational logic (or use a much more complex language to subvert that default logic). We lack good specification tools for inventing new operational logics, or combining elements from several. In particular, many novel systems of play arise from the investigation of interactive storytelling (Mateas and Stern 2003), multi-agent social interaction (McCoy et al. 2010), and procedurally generated behavior (Hartsook et al. 2011), and no existing tools make it especially straightforward for a novice developer to codify and reason about those systems. Ceptre is a proposal for an operational-logic-agnostic specification language that may form the basis of an accessible front-end tool. It is based on a tradition of logical frameworks (Harper, Honsell, and Plotkin 1993), which use logical formulas to represent the rules of a system (a specification). Then proof search may be used to simulate execution, answer queries, and perform analysis of the specification. In Ceptre, we specify games, generative systems, and narratives with similar payoff. Our logic of choice for representing games is linear logic (Girard 1987), unique among logics in its ability to model state change and actions without the need for a frame rule or other axiomatization of inertia for predicates that do not change in an action. Using linear logic to specify a space of play closely resembles planning approaches. Planning has been used extensively to study games, especially in the interactive storytelling domain (Mateas and Stern 2003; Porteous, Cavazza, and Charles 2010; Medler and Magerko 2006) but also as a general mechanic description language (Zook and Riedl 2014). In contrast to this work, we position Ceptre as unique among game description languages in its combination of (a) direct correspondence to a pre-existing logic and proof theory, providing a portable and robust foundation for reasoning about games, and (b) use as a native authoring language, rather than as a library or auxiliary tool. On the other hand, unlike prior executable description languages (e.g. (Dormans 2011; Osborn, Grow, and Mateas 2013)), we retain the planning-like ability to specify generalized rule schema that apply in a multi-agent setting, allowing for causal analysis of event sequences.

From an initial pilot study involving 25 pairs of middle and high school students, we find that most pairs preferred working on assignments in the Partner Puzzle mode as it presented a fun challenge to teams. We end on recommendations for building assignments using this methodology and future research directions investigating the role of collaboration in programming\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#34;","title":"Investigating Different Assignment Designs to Promote Collaboration in Block-Based Environments.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3366943","citation_key":"Lytle2020Investigating"},"color":"rgb(192,192,192)","size":10.0},{"label":"Slany (2012)","x":-2609.7978515625,"y":109.26850891113281,"id":"42","attributes":{"venue":"Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Interaction Design and Children","comm":"0","keywords":"bluetooth arduino board, drone quadcopters, android phone, programming environment, mobile visual programming system, lego mindstorms robot, visual programming language, inexpensive ar, image manipulation program, first-time user, control external hardware, educational, mobile, music, programming, visual programming, games","year":"2012","author":"Wolfgang Slany","dblp_id":"53e9b159b7602d9703bdb96d","description":"\u003ctable\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eAuthor:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eWolfgang Slany\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eTitle:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eCatroid: a mobile visual programming system for children\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSource:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eProceedings of the 12th International Conference on Interaction Design and Children\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eYear:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e2012\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/table\u003e","Cluster":"4","main":"1","abstract":"\u0026#34;Catroid is a free and open source visual programming language, programming environment, image manipulation program, and website.

This exploratory work contributes to work in educational data mining by broadly describing and comparing comments about projects versus other topics in Scratch. Referencing communication accommodation theory, we found that user comments about projects exhibited different linguistic cues than other comments, and these cues were successfully used to classify comment topic. Further, results also suggest that project comments embody richer language than other comments. This suggests several future avenues for research on youth\u0027s online comments about programming and other technical projects that may reveal educational opportunities in creating and sharing projects.\u0026#34;","title":"Novice Programmers Talking about Projects: What Automated Text Analysis Reveals about Online Scratch Users\u0027 Comments","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.2014.209","citation_key":"Velasquez2014Novice"},"color":"rgb(192,192,192)","size":10.0},{"label":"Tsukamoto (2015)","x":-2388.987548828125,"y":-189.30715942382812,"id":"97","attributes":{"venue":"FIE","comm":"0","keywords":"","year":"2015","author":"Hidekuni Tsukamoto, Yasuhiro Takemura, Hideo Nagumo, Isamu Ikeda, Akito Monden, Ken-ichi Matsumoto","dblp_id":"573698086e3b12023e6dfe99","description":"\u003ctable\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eAuthor:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eHidekuni Tsukamoto\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eTitle:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eProgramming education for primary school children using a textual programming language\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSource:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eFIE\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eYear:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e2015\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/table\u003e","Cluster":"4","main":"1","abstract":"\u0026#34; \u0026#34;","title":"Programming education for primary school children using a textual programming language","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2015.7344187","citation_key":"Tsukamoto2015Programming"},"color":"rgb(255,136,5)","size":11.666666984558105},{"label":"Fernaeus (2003)","x":-668.1505737304688,"y":80.4035873413086,"id":"6","attributes":{"venue":"IDC","comm":"0","keywords":"games, programming, children, human computer interaction, game programming","year":"2003","author":"Ylva Fernaeus, Jakob Tholander","dblp_id":"53e99abeb7602d970233bf55","description":"\u003ctable\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eAuthor:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eYlva Fernaeus\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eTitle:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eGames to explore programming.\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSource:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eIDC\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eYear:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e2003\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/table\u003e","Cluster":"3","main":"1","abstract":"\u0026#34;\u0026#34;","title":"Games to explore programming.","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/953536.953571","citation_key":"Fernaeus2003Games"},"color":"rgb(76,70,62)","size":10.0},{"label":"Fessakis (2013)","x":59.45588302612305,"y":-978.3487548828125,"id":"91","attributes":{"venue":"Computers \u0026#38; Education","comm":"0","keywords":"social skill, computer programming, exploratory case study, interactive white board, engaging learning activity, computer programming environment, research evidence, years old kindergarten child, analogous computer programming problem, whole-class social mode, educational technology, interviews, intervention, programming, teaching methods","year":"2013","author":"G.

Its horizontal integration throughout all educational levels is considered worthwhile and attracts the attention of researchers. Towards this direction, an exploratory case study is presented concerning dimensions of problem solving using computer programming by 5-6 years old kindergarten children. After a short introductory experiential game the children were involved in solving a series of analogous computer programming problems, using a Logo-based environment on an Interactive White Board. The intervention was designed as a part of the structured learning activities of the kindergarten which are teacher-guided and are conducted in a whole-class social mode. The observation of the video recording of the intervention along with the analysis of teacher\u0027s interview and the researcher\u0027s notes allow for a realistic evaluation of the feasibility, the appropriateness and the learning value of integrating computer programming in such a context. The research evidence supports the view that children enjoyed the engaging learning activities and had opportunities to develop mathematical concepts, problem solving and social skills. Interesting results about children learning, difficulties, interactions, problem solving strategies and the teacher\u0027s role are reported.

Narrative Threads is a suite of software tools designed to aid young people (aged 11-15) in creating their own narrative-based games as a writing development activity. A participatory design process highlighted the areas where additional support was required, and informed the iterative design of Narrative Threads. The tools are implemented as a plugin to a commercial game creation toolset, and constitute character and object design tools, a branching narrative diagramming tool and an augmented story map view. In this paper, we provide an overview of the design of the tools and describe an evaluation carried out with 14 children over a four-day workshop. The study examined tool usage patterns, and compared games created with Narrative Threads to those created using the standard toolset. The results suggest a number of ways in which dynamic external representations of story elements can support writing activities in narrative-based game creation. Young designers using Narrative Threads wrote more character dialogue, made stronger links between the conversations they wrote and wider game events, and designed more complex characters, compared to those using the standard toolset. In addition to showing how Narrative Threads can support young games designers, the results have broader implications for anyone looking to support storytelling and writing through game creation activities and tools.\u0026#34;","title":"Narrative support for young game designers\u0027 writing","url":"http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2771839.2771858","citation_key":"Howland2015Narrative"},"color":"rgb(223,137,255)","size":13.333333969116211},{"label":"Monteiro (2015)","x":4218.64013671875,"y":-1341.10595703125,"id":"87","attributes":{"venue":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science","comm":"15","keywords":"Computational thinking acquisition, Programming as self-expression, Reflective computing","year":"2015","author":"Ingrid Teixeira Monteiro, Clarisse Sieckenius de Souza, Eduardo Tiomno Tolmasquim","dblp_id":"573697036e3b12023e5fd562","description":"\u003ctable\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eAuthor:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eIngrid Teixeira Monteiro\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eTitle:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eMy Program, My World: Insights from 1st-Person Reflective Programming in EUD Education\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSource:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eLecture Notes in Computer Science\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eYear:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e2015\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/table\u003e","Cluster":"18","main":"1","abstract":"\u0026#34;An important factor underlying the entire EUD enterprise is how to incorporate basic computer programming in school curricula.

Three iterations (cycles) were designed and examined in total, with participants aged 8\u0026#8211;17 years old, using mixed methods. Over the two years, we conducted workshops in which students used a block-based programming environment (i.e., Scratch) and collaboratively created a socially meaningful artifact (i.e., a game). The study identifies nine design principles that can help us to achieve higher engagement during the coding activity. Moreover, positive attitudes and high motivation were found to result in the better management of cognitive load. Our contribution lies in the theoretical grounding of the results in constructionism and the emerging design principles.

At that time the medium in question was television. As the Sesame Street television show prepares to celebrate its 35th year on the air, the television programming schedule now includes a wide variety of other educational programming for young children, and researchers are in almost universal agreement that television can be used successfully for educational purposes. In recent years, the Workshop has faced the same challenge with a variety of interactive entertainment media (including videogames, DVD, and interactive television); i.e., these media all might have potential for educating children, but neither the platforms themselves nor the typical programming for these media are being planned with any particular thought toward education. This paper describes how the Sesame Street \u0026#34;experiment\u0026#34; has been continued and extended, by adapting interactive media platforms designed for entertainment so that they can be used to deliver educational experiences to young children. The paper also outlines Sesame Workshop\u0027s educational philosophy and approach, as applied in the interactive arena, and identifies some of the challenges and solutions in designing interfaces and interactive educational experiences that can be used and enjoyed by preschool-age children. Two specific research projects are described as examples of this approach: one details the development of an adapted software interface to make console videogame systems accessible to young children and the other evaluates a new approach to creating interactive television programming for young children on a DVD platform.\u0026#34;","title":"Educating via entertainment media: the Sesame Workshop approach","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/950566.950590","citation_key":"Revelle2003Educating"},"color":"rgb(192,192,192)","size":10.0},{"label":"Plaza (2018)","x":2574.04052734375,"y":3068.322021484375,"id":"143","attributes":{"venue":"TALE","comm":"23","keywords":" ","year":"2018","author":"Pedro Plaza, Elio Sancristobal, German Carro, Manuel Blazquez, Felix Garcia-Loro, Sergio Martin, Clara Perez, Manuel Castro","dblp_id":"5ce2d105ced107d4c63e1861","description":"\u003ctable\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eAuthor:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003ePedro Plaza\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eTitle:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eArduino as an Educational Tool to Introduce Robotics\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSource:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eTALE\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eYear:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e2018\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/table\u003e","Cluster":"26","main":"1","abstract":"\u0026#34;Short Description-The aim of this paper is to introduce the use of Arduino, an established tool in the development of applications and deployment of educational content, as of a course related to the introduction to robotics. Robotics requires several skills and competencies that can be easily developed with tools like Arduino. These skills and competencies are related to the areas of knowledge used for the development of robotic applications, such as computer science, electricity, electronics and mechanics. Throughout this paper we present Arduino, the resources used for the deployment of the course and the results obtained from the educational experiences carried out. The results of the educational robotics course demonstrate how children with previous experience in Scratch programming, skills and competencies with simple Crumble-based robots can continue the learning process through classroom experiences using Arduino. In this way, students can improve skills and competencies already worked with tools such as Scratch and Crumble. Another important observation from the results is that it is important to adapt the difficulty of the content to each child. Finally, it is important to combine theory and practice to include fun and intertwined tasks with the challenges of applying theory to problem solving.\u0026#34;","title":"Arduino as an Educational Tool to Introduce Robotics","url":"","citation_key":"Plaza2018Arduino"},"color":"rgb(192,192,192)","size":10.0},{"label":"Fernaeus (2006)","x":-756.9234008789062,"y":355.3825378417969,"id":"36","attributes":{"venue":"Interacting with Computers","comm":"0","keywords":"computer programming, children\u0026#8217;s programming, interaction design, social perspective, conceptual understanding, interactive process, performance in interaction design, own computer game, bodily action, tangible programming, interactive system, specific focus, design idea, joint performance, human computer interaction","year":"2006","author":"Ylva Fernaeus, Jakob Tholander","dblp_id":"53e9adaab7602d97037aa6f8","description":"\u003ctable\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eAuthor:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eYlva Fernaeus\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eTitle:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eDesigning for programming as joint performances among groups of children\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSource:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eInteracting with Computers\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eYear:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e2006\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/table\u003e","Cluster":"3","main":"1","abstract":"\u0026#34;Research on computer programming usually views the interactions as mostly cognitively based, with focus on concepts such as memory, perception and conceptual understanding.

We have explored a range of activities and tools that explicitly address these aspects in programming, with a specific focus on children\u0027s making of own computer games and simulations. We exemplify this work through three different situations where tools and activities are used by children as recourses for building of interactive systems, while at the same time allowing for bodily action in negotiation of design ideas. We discuss how situations like these may provide directions for new technologies for programming as well as methodological developments in the area of interaction design.\u0026#34;","title":"Designing for programming as joint performances among groups of children","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.intcom.2006.05.004","citation_key":"Fernaeus2006Designing"},"color":"rgb(76,70,62)","size":10.0},{"label":"Magnenat (2008)","x":2894.077392578125,"y":3015.665771484375,"id":"55","attributes":{"venue":"Fun and Games 2010","comm":"9","keywords":"mobile robots programming, open-source multiplayer introduction, great pedagogical potential, educational purpose, open-source mobile robot, inherent fun, robotic survival challenge simulation, hundred child, programming, robot, mobile robot","year":"2008","author":"St\u0026#233;phane Magnenat, Basilio Noris, Francesco Mondada","dblp_id":"53e9bce1b7602d970496625a","description":"\u003ctable\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eAuthor:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSt\u0026#233;phane Magnenat\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eTitle:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eAseba-Challenge: An Open-Source Multiplayer Introduction to Mobile Robots Programming\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSource:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eFun and Games 2010\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eYear:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e2008\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/table\u003e","Cluster":"10","main":"1","abstract":"\u0026#34;We present in this paper a realistic looking robotic survival challenge simulation.

Games have been developed to teach basic concepts of programming such as deriving logic, writing code, debugging the code and so on. Debugging code is one of the most important activities that can improve the skill of tackling a problem. In programming, one needs to identify the correct location of an error and fix it, which is usually learned through experience. Games have been developed to teach debugging to novice programmers. Syntactical errors occur frequently in the early stages of programming. The existing debugging games aim to support users in debugging the logic of the problem, but do not target on correcting the code snippets based on syntax. To address this challenge of providing syntactical support, we propose a treasure hunt based debugging game, in which users pass through various levels of the game by debugging code snippets written in C language. We have evaluated G4D based on MEEGA+ model, with 20 volunteers, having different programming backgrounds. The results of the user survey indicate that G4D has a good quality level and about 75% of the volunteers have either strongly agreed or agreed to recommend G4D to their colleagues.\u0026#34;","title":"G4D - a treasure hunt game for novice programmers to learn debugging","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40561-020-00129-4","citation_key":"Venigalla2020G4D"},"color":"rgb(115,192,0)","size":10.0},{"label":"Ahmadi (2012)","x":-2267.034912109375,"y":1062.8687744140625,"id":"31","attributes":{"venue":"CDVE","comm":"0","keywords":"","year":"2012","author":"Navid Ahmadi, Mehdi Jazayeri, Monica Landoni","dblp_id":"53e9a6aeb7602d9702fe42f3","description":"\u003ctable\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eAuthor:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eNavid Ahmadi\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eTitle:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eEnabling Cooperative Educational Game Design on the Web.\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSource:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eCDVE\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eYear:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e2012\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/table\u003e","Cluster":"4","main":"1","abstract":"\u0026#34;\u0026#34;","title":"Enabling Cooperative Educational Game Design on the Web.","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-32609-7_8","citation_key":"Ahmadi2012Enabling"},"color":"rgb(255,136,5)","size":15.0},{"label":"Hu (2015)","x":1057.03125,"y":-1114.572998046875,"id":"136","attributes":{"venue":"Interaction Design and Children","comm":"0","keywords":"","year":"2015","author":"Felix Hu, Ariel Zekelman, Michael Horn, Frances Judd","dblp_id":"573697616e3b12023e64a092","description":"\u003ctable\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eAuthor:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eFelix Hu\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eTitle:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eStrawbies: explorations in tangible programming\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSource:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eInteraction Design and Children\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eYear:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e2015\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/table\u003e","Cluster":"5","main":"1","abstract":"\u0026#34;In this demo we present Strawbies, a realtime tangible programming game designed for children ages 5 to 10.

The research on this topic has primarily focused on children as players of computer games rather than builders/constructors of computer games. Recently, several game companies, such as BioWare Corp. and Bethesda Softworks, have released game story creation tools to the public, along with their games. However, a major obstacle to using these commercial tools is the level of programming experience required to create interactive game stories. In this paper, we demonstrate that a commercial game story construction tool, BioWare Corp.\u0027s Aurora Toolset, can be augmented by our new tool, ScriptEase, to enable students in two grade ten English classes to successfully construct interactive game stories. We present evidence that describes the relationship between interactive story authoring and traditional story authoring, along with a series of factors that can potentially affect success at these activities: gender, creativity, intellectual ability, previous experiences with programming, time playing computer games, and time spent online. Results indicate that students can successfully construct sophisticated interactive stories with very little training. The results also show no gender differences in the quality of these interactive stories, regardless of programming experience or the amount of time per week playing computer games or participating in general online activities, although a subset of female students did show a slightly higher level of performance on interactive story authoring. In the educational context of this study, we show that ScriptEase provides an easy-to-use tool for interactive story authoring in a constructionist learning environment.\u0026#34;","title":"Interactive story authoring: A viable form of creative expression for the classroom","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2007.07.007","citation_key":"Carbonaro2008Interactive"},"color":"rgb(223,137,255)","size":11.666666984558105},{"label":"Garner (2005)","x":-4168.49072265625,"y":-17.320592880249023,"id":"11","attributes":{"venue":"ACE","comm":"1","keywords":"refining course material, ongoing study, preliminary investigation, individual lab session, introductory java programming class, different problem distribution, procedural aspect, fundamental design issue, problem definition, novice programmer, laboratory session, data collection","year":"2005","author":"Sandy Garner, Patricia Haden, Anthony Robins","dblp_id":"53e9b457b7602d9703f50da1","description":"\u003ctable\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eAuthor:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSandy Garner\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eTitle:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eMy program is correct but it doesn\u0027t run: a preliminary investigation of novice programmers\u0027 problems\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSource:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eACE\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eYear:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e2005\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/table\u003e","Cluster":"11","main":"1","abstract":"\u0026#34;In this paper we describe an ongoing study of novice programmers.

Extending both the visual formalism and open source code base of Snap!, NetsBlox provides two accessible distributed programming abstractions to simplify the process of creating networked applications: message passing and Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). Messaging passing allows NetsBlox applications to send data to other connected NetsBlox clients. Remote Procedure Calls enable seamless integration of third party services, such as Google Maps, weather, traffic and other public domain data sources, into NetsBlox applications. Other RPCs help coordinating distributed clients which may be difficult for novice programmers allowing the user to more quickly create captivating and sophisticated applications. These abstractions empower users to develop networked programs, including multi-player games and client-server applications. By providing networking support, NetsBlox not only allows users to learn distribute programming concepts but also makes programming more engaging by incorporating diverse services available on the web.\u0026#34;","title":"A Visual Programming Environment for Learning Distributed Programming.","url":"http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3017680.3017741","citation_key":"Broll2017A"},"color":"rgb(192,192,192)","size":10.0},{"label":"Mongkhonvanit (2018)","x":-1606.3916015625,"y":2899.490478515625,"id":"119","attributes":{"venue":"IDC","comm":"19","keywords":" ","year":"2018","author":"Kritphong Mongkhonvanit, Claire Jia Yi Zau, Chris Proctor, Paulo Blikstein","dblp_id":"5b3d986f17c44a510f7fac04","description":"\u003ctable\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eAuthor:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eKritphong Mongkhonvanit\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eTitle:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eTestudinata: a tangible interface for exploring functional programming.\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSource:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eIDC\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eYear:\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e2018\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/table\u003e","Cluster":"22","main":"1","abstract":"\u0026#34;Learning to program is difficult for most children.

Using Testudinata, learners can design, implement, and test various compositions of pre-made functions on a tangible user interface (TUI), while observing and comparing results on a graphical user interface (GUI).

While some research has examined the impact of feedback on student learning in programming, there is no work (to our knowledge) that examines the impact of adaptive immediate feedback within programming environments on students\u0027 desire to persist in computer science (CS). In this paper, we integrate an adaptive immediate feedback (AIF) system into a block-based programming environment. Our AIF system is novel because it provides personalized positive and corrective feedback to students in real time as they work. In a controlled pilot study with novice high-school programmers, we show that our AIF system significantly increased students\u0027 intentions to persist in CS, and that students using AIF had greater engagement (as measured by their lower idle time) compared to students in the control condition. Further, we found evidence that the AIF system may improve student learning, as measured by student performance in a subsequent task without AIF. In interviews, students found the system fun and helpful, and reported feeling more focused and engaged.

This is not surprising since its design and user interface were strongly influenced by games like The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Robot Odyssey. What may be more surprising is that ToonTalk is a programming language and environment based upon ideas that have evolved from Prolog over a period of nearly twenty years. ToonTalk is a synthesis of ideas from concurrent constraint programming, video games, and programming languages for children. In the spirit of Logo (3), ToonTalk is an attempt to take the best ideas in computer science and make them accessible to children. When Logo was designed over thirty years ago, the best programming language ideas could be found in the Lisp language. The design of ToonTalk is based upon the belief that the best programming language ideas can be found in concurrent logic programming and concurrent constraint programming languages like Janus, Linear Janus, FGHC, Vulcan, DOC, AKL, and Oz (4,5,6). These languages, in turn, borrow heavily from earlier languages like Concurrent Prolog and Parlog that in turn grew out of research on Prolog. While these languages have many desirable aspects - they are powerful, elegant, theoretically well grounded, and expressive - they are not generally considered easy to learn. If it takes substantial time and effort for computer scientists to understand one of these languages, then how can one hope to make the underlying ideas accessible to young school children? An answer lies with video games. Many of these games present a large and complex world with many kinds of objects and possible actions. And yet, children as young as 4 years old learn to master these game worlds without help. The fundamental idea underlying ToonTalk is that a game world can be created in which the objects and actions map directly onto programming language constructs. In ToonTalk, a clause becomes a robot, a term or tuple becomes a box, a number becomes a pad, and so on. The act of putting a box and a team of robots into a truck becomes a way of expressing a process spawn or procedure call. The act of dropping a number pad on another number pad becomes a way of expressing an arithmetic operation.
