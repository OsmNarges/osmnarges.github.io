I am a graduate student in Computer Science at McMaster University's Faculty of Engineering. In pursuit of my Master's thesis at McMaster, I focused on building an innovative editor tailored for teaching Elm programming and computer science fundamentals to kids and novice programmers.

My academic journey spans across continents, as I hold another Master's degree from the University of Pisa, Italy, specializing in Digital Humanities. During my time there, I immersed myself in data science courses and undertook a thesis centered on telecom data science, which reflects my passion in data science, analytics and machine learning.

From developing educational tools to delving into telecom data analytics, my diverse experiences have honed my skills and fueled my enthusiasm for leveraging data-driven approaches to solve real-world challenges. You can find more details about some of my projects on the [projects page](/projects/).
